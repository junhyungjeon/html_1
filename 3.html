      JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript
      specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm.
      It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation and first-class functions.
      Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
