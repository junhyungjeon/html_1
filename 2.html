      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of
      a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of
      the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
      CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout,
      colors, and fonts
